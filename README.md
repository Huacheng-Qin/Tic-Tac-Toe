# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic-tac-toe spin off game where the user can increase the board size

IMPORTANT: 
1. The program is Windows-specific.
2. The program uses _getch() from the header file <conio.h>.
3. I did NOT create the file "colours.h".

The players are able to choose the size of the board as well as how many pieces
they need to connect in order to win.
For example, the user could choose to make the board size 19x19 and require 
5 pieces connected in a row to win, effectively turning this game into Gomoku.
